# UCS761 – Deep Learning Lab Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to selected **Deep Learning laboratory assignments** for the course **UCS761**.  
The main objective of these experiments is to strengthen conceptual understanding by implementing core machine learning models **from scratch using NumPy**, without using high-level deep learning libraries.

## 🧪 Experiment 1: Logistic Regression as a Soft Decision Model

📘 **Notebook:**  
`Logistic_Regression_Soft_Decision_Model.ipynb`

### Objective
To analyze logistic regression as a **probability-based classification model** and understand how it improves upon hard decision models like the perceptron.

### Topics Covered
- Sigmoid activation and probability outputs
- Binary Cross-Entropy loss
- Gradient Descent optimization
- Effect of varying decision thresholds
- Comparison between perceptron and logistic regression

---

## 🧪 Experiment 2: Multiple Linear Regression using Linear Perceptron

📘 **Notebook:**  
`Multi_Linear_Regression_via_Linear_Perceptron.ipynb`

### Objective
To implement **multiple linear regression** using a perceptron-based linear model trained with a regression loss function.

### Topics Covered
- Regression vs classification concepts
- Linear forward computation (no activation)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
- Manual gradient calculation
- Gradient Descent for parameter updates
- Continuous prediction behavior

---

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcome

> A single linear model can be adapted for both **classification and regression** tasks by modifying the **loss function and output interpretation**, without changing the underlying model structure.
